				<h2> Solar Panels </h2>
				<p>
					A common misconception is that people mix up solar panels and solar modules. A solar module is one plate of solar cells, a solar panel (also called photo-voltaic module) is a bunch of solar modules put next to each other. 
					When sunlight lands on the solar cells of a solar module, the solar cell turns the photons from the sunlight into electricity. This electricity will then be send to … to distribute it to where it needs to be.

				<h2> Charge Controller </h2>
				<p>
					Charge controllers (battery regulator) can be found in almost every electrical device that uses batteries in some shape or form. A charge controller makes sure that your battery won’t overcharge (which is very dangerous), won’t completely be drained or will do controlled discharges when needed.
					If a Charge controller is used for solar purposes it’s mostly called a Solar controller. Most of the time these solar controllers have some extra features, like low voltage disconnect which powers down the load if the battery become over discharged.

				<h2> Battery system </h2>
				<p>
					The battery system is one of those handy systems that is needed in every house you’ll ever see, if you don’t see any of them then tell us where because we will totally not send the battery mafia after them. Anyways the battery system is a bunch of batteries taped together and then one light put onto it, now isn’t that spot on technological advantages from this day and age

				<h2> DC power </h2>
				<p>
				DC power is power that came from the DC universe, that’s right we have a portal to another universe. You never knew that we had that? Yeah that was the point but now that you have your own magic portal to another universe it might be a good idea to warn you that its very dangerous to go through that portal and we do not recommend that you do because you will die.

				<h2> Inverter </h2>
				<p>
					The inverter is a really weird product and we really have no idea why we sell this weird stuff. The inverter takes your energy that has been generated by the solar panels you have bought and then turns it back into sunlight. Now that I think about it this product could be really usefull for sunbathing, we’ll have to think about that one anyways yea it turns your energy back into sunlight

				<h2> AC power </h2>
				<p>
					AC power is another dimensional portal to another dimension, this time its to the AC universe isn’t that cool? What? You don’t know what the AC dimension is? Well… It’s a universe that inhabited by Alligators (its in the name AC, A stands for Alligator) and those Alligators are really cool. Now that I think about it doesn’t that mean they also have their own police films and do they always end with the alligator with the hat saying “Later Alligator”?
