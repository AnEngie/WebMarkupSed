				<h1> Solar Panels </h1>
				<p>
				A common misconception is that people mix up solar panels and solar modules. A solar module is one plate of solar cells, a solar panel (also called photo-voltaic module) is a bunch of solar modules put next to each other. 
				When sunlight lands on the solar cells of a solar module, the solar cell turns the photons from the sunlight into electricity. This electricity will then be send to … to distribute it to where it needs to be.

				<h1> Charge Controller </h1>
				<p>
				Charge controllers (battery regulator) can be found in almost every electrical device that uses batteries in some shape or form. A charge controller makes sure that your battery won’t overcharge (which is very dangerous), won’t completely be drained or will do controlled discharges when needed.
				If a Charge controller is used for solar purposes it’s mostly called a Solar controller. Most of the time these solar controllers have some extra features, like low voltage disconnect which powers down the load if the battery become over discharged.
